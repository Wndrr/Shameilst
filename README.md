# Shameilst
This is a very bare-bone implementation of a to-do list in Blazor Server using netcore 3.1 build by Mathieu VIALES
It is primarily a means for me to learn the technology, but ultimately this web application is meant to become a real web-app.

## What the Whoot ?
Currently, it's just a to-do list (barely, even). What makes it "special" is the idea of "shame" and "pride". The main goal of this projet is to allow you to create lists of task that you intent to have achieved before a givent date and have you friends follow your progress. They can give you "shame" or "pride" points depending on your progress. If you don't meet your deadlines, they shame you. If you succeed, they're proud of you (or not, depends if your friends are assholes)
